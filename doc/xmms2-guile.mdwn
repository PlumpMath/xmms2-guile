# DESCRIPTION

`xmms2-guile` is a native implementation of the XMMS2 protocol, aimed to
implement client applications to control an XMMS2 server. It has no external
depencencies, not on any foreign libraries that would be accessed via a
foreign-function-interface, nor for non-core Guile Scheme libraries.

The library has a couple of loosely connected parts: One part implements the
data serialisation and deserialisation to actually exchange data with a
server. Another part implements the low-level network code that actually
connects to a server. Other parts implement special data-types and XMMS2
specific value handling. Yet other parts implement all the inter-process
communication API that an XMMS2 server supports. And finally there are higher
level modules, that should make it more convenient to implement actual clients
on top of the library.

This manual aims to be a reference into all parts of the library. A full
library reference is a requirement for a `0.2.0` release. The plan is to
scrape function descriptions from source files as much as possible and to add
additional information as markdown text right in here.
